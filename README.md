## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Use google and stackoverflow to solve the issues, like how to put the image to the place I want it to be
- Learnt this new css rules (transform)

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  transform: translateY(5%);
}
```

- when using the google fonts, I need to import the different bold style, otherwise it might not work when I apply them.

### Continued development

- More and more practice
- Learn efficient solutions (mine is simple, maybe not smart enough)
- Write down my thinking process while doing the next task!
